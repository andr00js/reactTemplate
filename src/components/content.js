            Hello World.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Enjoy this minimalist React template.

            Try not to alter the index.html, index.js, or app.js files. The browser router has already been configured.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In the pages folder, you will find router.js, where you can define url routes, and home.js, the home page component. Inside the homepage I have loaded the content component. You can add a second page by creating a new .js file in the pages folder and adding the route in the router.js file.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            If you would like to add a component that is included in more than one page, you should create a .js file and add it to the component page, and then either import this component to the pages, or add it to the router file itself in order to have it appear on all pages.

            There are two style sheets included. app.css should hold general styles, while components.css should hold styles for particular components.
